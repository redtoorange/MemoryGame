# Godot Memory Game
Small project I created to learn the Godot Engine while transitioning away from Unity. This project renders 3D tiles using an orthographic camera. The tiles have an outline generated with a shader and a screen space post processing effect.

* [Art Work](https://artoftic.itch.io/pixelart-16x16-fooddrinks)

## Opening the Project
Required Godot 4.2+

## Notes
I have removed the artwork from the game as it was acquired under a limited useage license. This will cause the project to break if trying to run from the editor.
